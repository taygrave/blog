### Britney Spears Conservatorship

* *\#freebritney, conservatorship, sexism, outrageous, pop culture*
* If you are wondering wtf is going on with this whole situation, this entire series is a shocking thrill to listen to, or you can just listen to this one episode to get straight into the gritty details of how insane and controlling and appalling it all appears to be.

### Burnout: The Nagoski Sisters

* *career, stress, well-being, self-care*
* Burnout is real and it's real bad. The Nagoski sisters wrote <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/burnout-the-secret-to-unlocking-the-stress-cycle/9781984818324" target="_blank">an excellent book</a> about it that <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3844087491" target="_blank">I highly recommend</a> everyone read, but if you don't have time to read it or wanna try before you buy, check out either one of these podcasts that host them and talk about their findings and recommendations. Top learning: Separate the stress from the stressor, and deal with each separately ðŸ¤¯.

### Race and White Privilege

* *race, white privilege, history, united states*
* This entire series is a must-listen for all white Americans at least, and would likely benefit anyone who listens. A really well-done and in-depth look at racial inequity and the social construct of race. Important.

### Mushrooms & Trees

* *nature show, mycelium, forest, trees, interconnectedness*
* This episode changed the way I thought about the physical world. Apparently there are miles and miles and MILES of dense mycelium networks spread out across the world right underneath our feet. And they have a relationship with the trees, and trees communicate with each other, and send each other matter! This is absolutely wild and a must-listen for every person on the planet.
