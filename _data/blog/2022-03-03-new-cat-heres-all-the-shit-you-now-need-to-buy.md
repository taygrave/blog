metaDescription: >-
  I've had two cats (the Kittybeans) for 7 years now, these are the things and
  products that work for us.

So you got a cat! Or better yet, two cats! Amazing, congratulations, I'm so happy for you and your new Beans, and how enriched your life will be now with your new little love(s). 



So what kind of shit do you need? After years of trial and error, here's where me and my kittybeans are at - hopefully our trials can save you some time, money, and effort: 



## Eating

We have QUITE a setup, and we LIKE IT!

Get an automatic feeder. Yes, it can be very sweet and bonding to feed them yourself / by hand - and you still can! Whenever you want! But get a feeder as your foundation so they are NEVER trained to wake you up at night or way-too-early in the morning for a snack. No chores for you, consistent schedule for kitty, and also makes it super easy for you to travel or be away for a short period of time / supplement a pet-sitter's schedule. 

TL;DR: IT MAKES ALL YOUR LIVES EASIER. 

I've only ever purchased one feeder, back in 2017 - and it has been AWESOME for us, still going strong:

Hoping to lessen food-competition between the cats, we messed around with getting a [3D-printed divider](https://amzn.to/3CjwAos) for it, but it didn't make much difference, still using it though, shrug.

Now I just set it to dose out the smallest portions several times a day. I think this helps reduce any feels of scarcity / competition for the cats, and also provides multiple moments of stimulation and excitement for the cats - and keeps them from eating too much too quickly. I LOVE how customizable the settings are! 

ONCE: We had a problem with ants, so I measured and purchased [this wide and shallow tray](https://amzn.to/3HHlieF), filled it with water, then also bought this [3-pack of trays](https://amzn.to/3Mlp5ll) and placed one upside down and put the automatic feeder on top of that upside-down tray. This effectively created a moat-barrier that the ants will not cross / cannot infiltrate the feeder. I use the remaining two trays to catch the food - the sides are high enough that not much food spills out, and because they are stainless steel they don't give the Beans chin acne. 

Food dishes: Make sure they are stainless steel to prevent chin acne! We are using these now, they are easy to toss in the wash and the right size to mash wetfood around in. The print is cute but fading a bit over the last couple years now, we don't mind.

## Litter

Ok, this one was more of a journey for us.
